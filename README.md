## About the DAS metadata reporting format

todo: Your README.md file should contain a short description of your repository. This can be placed either directly under the title of your README file as we wrote the few sentences above or you can write a description under an "About" heading like we have included here. This is also a good place to link out to additional supporting documentation on other non-github websites.

## Getting started  

todo: The getting started section of your repository is like a table of contents that lists out a concise version of the most important documents and templates a reader can expect to find in your repository. You do not need to link to every  document in your GitHub repository, but you should link to the most essential documents, so that visitors can locate and access them quickly.

## Updates in v1.0.0

â€¢ This is the first release of the DAS Metadata Reporting Format

## How to contribute  

todo: Provide details in this section that lets readers know how to suggest modifications to your repository.

We also suggest that you set up issue templates, so that when users submit a GitHub issue, they do so in a format you specify. Examples of issue templates can be found [here](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/essdive-file-level-metadata/issues/new/choose).  

## Copyright information

GitHub has put together a helpful guide on repository licensing: https://choosealicense.com/ If you eventually upload your repository as a complete data package to the ESS-DIVE data repository, the data package will have either a CC BY 4.0 or a CC BY 1.0 and you should indicate that license here.
